## 💡 Key Insights Discovered

### 1. "Configuration as Code" Philosophy
**Insight:** Everything is defined in code (SQL, YAML, Python)
- ✅ Reproducible: Anyone can recreate your environment
- ✅ Versionable: Track changes over time
- ✅ Testable: Automated validation
- ✅ Documented: Self-explanatory code

### 2. "Separation of Concerns" Pattern
**Insight:** Each layer has a specific purpose
- `01_staging/` - Clean and standardize raw data
- `02_intermediate/` - Business logic and joins
- `03_mart/` - Analytics-ready dimensional models

### 3. "Data Quality as Code" Mindset
**Insight:** Tests are defined alongside models
- Not an afterthought
- Run automatically
- Catch issues early
- Document expectations

### 4. "Modern Data Stack" Architecture
**Insight:** Cloud-native, SQL-based, git-versioned
```
Raw Data (Snowflake)
    ↓
dbt Transformations (SQL + Jinja)
    ↓
Clean Data (Snowflake)
    ↓
Analytics Tools (Tableau, Power BI, etc.)
```

## 🔍 Common Mistakes & How You Avoided Them

### Mistake 1: Not Using Virtual Environments
**Why it's bad:** Global package conflicts, hard to reproduce
**How you avoided it:** Used `uv venv` from the start

### Mistake 2: Hardcoding Credentials
**Why it's bad:** Security risk, not shareable
**How you avoided it:** Used `profiles.yml` with environment variables

### Mistake 3: No Testing
**Why it's bad:** Silent data quality issues
**How you avoided it:** Added tests in `stg_customers.yml`

### Mistake 4: Poor Documentation
**Why it's bad:** Can't remember what you did, hard to share
**How you avoided it:** Created comprehensive docs at each step

### Mistake 5: No Version Control
**Why it's bad:** Can't track changes, can't rollback
**How you avoided it:** Git from day one with meaningful commits
